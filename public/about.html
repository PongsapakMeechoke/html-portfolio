<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Pongsapak Meechoke or You can call me Nu. I am web developer. I used to be a civil engineer.
  I come form Thailand. I am graduate form King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.
  I really appreciate you coming to get to know me :D.
</p>

<p>I would like to tell my story of why this was my career path and the path I took to learn coding from scratch.</p>

<p>I was 23 years old at the time. I had just graduated and started working in the civil engineering field I had studied.
  It was then that I realized in some ways that I was not suited to work in site engineering. As I just graduated, 
  So I wanted to try this career path as a draftsman. However, being a small company,
  the number of people in site engineering positions is not enough.So I had the opportunity to do both positions at the same time.
  But with problems during working hours, working hours that do not correspond to needs and poor health from insufficient repayments.
  It made me choose to resign and change my career path.
</p>

<p>Because I saw it in myself when I took a coding class in high school. Made me choose to change to this career field.
  I started taking foundation classes to refresh the old knowledge I had learned. Even though it's almost non-existent XD.
  After I graduated, I looked for a course that taught me from beginning to end in web development.
  I would like to tell everyone who is thinking of starting to study this path that "The first step will always be difficult.
  But when did you take your first step? As you move forward it will become easier and easier.
  It's up to you whether you choose to take the first step or not. That's it." 
</p>

<p>If you read this far I encourage you to learn this. Every route has problems.
  But in the end, you will definitely find a way to solve that problem. Hope it can be a good story for you. appreciate that a lot.
</p>
